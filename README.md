# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

### Purpose:

 - After creating the school district analysis for Maria, she has now let me know that the board has found academic dishonesty within the [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/Sebjet24/School_District_Analysis/files/7614742/schools_complete.csv)
[students_complete.csv](https://github.com/Sebjet24/School_District_Analysis/files/7614743/students_complete.csv). Specifically regarding the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. To uphold the data, I need to clean out the 9th grade class's reading and math grades from the end result. Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that I did and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
